In this repository I will add codes based on finite difference method used to simulate fluid particle based motion
1D Burgers' Equation Solver using Finite Difference Method
This repository contains a Python implementation of the 1D Burgers' equation using the explicit finite difference method. The Burgers' equation is a fundamental PDE in fluid mechanics that combines non-linear convection and diffusion:
